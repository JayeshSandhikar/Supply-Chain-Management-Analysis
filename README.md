# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analytics Project

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. Currently operational in three cities - Vadodra, Surat, and Ahmedabad - the company aims to expand to other metro/tier 1 cities within the next 2 years.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is facing challenges with retaining key customers due to service issues. Some customers have not extended their annual contracts, potentially due to delays or incomplete deliveries of essential products. Management recognizes the urgency of addressing these service issues before expanding to other cities.

## Project Objective

To improve customer service levels and address delivery issues, the supply chain analytics team has been tasked with tracking the 'On Time' and 'In Full' delivery performance for all customers on a daily basis. By monitoring these metrics closely, the management aims to respond swiftly to any service issues that arise.

## Approach

The supply chain team will utilize a standardized approach to measure the service level. Key metrics include:

- **On-Time Delivery (OT) %:** Percentage of customer orders delivered on time.
- **In-Full Delivery (IF) %:** Percentage of customer orders delivered in full.
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %:** Percentage of customer orders delivered both on time and in full.

These metrics will be tracked daily against the target service level set for each customer.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Analysis Scripts:** Contains scripts for collecting, processing, and analyzing delivery data.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation on data sources, data processing methods, and analysis techniques.
- **Reports:** Weekly/monthly reports on delivery performance, highlighting any deviations from target service levels.
- **Recommendations:** Actionable recommendations based on data analysis to improve delivery performance.
